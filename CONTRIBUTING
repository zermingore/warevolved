TL;DR
-----

In order for a Pull Request to be accepted:
- The tests should pass
- The documentation should be updated
- The coding style should be respected



Getting started
---------------

Though a fairly up to date TODO exists,
you may want to add your own feature / bug fix.
As long as it does not conflict with the project philosophy, go for it;
In doubt, ask the maintainer.

If you face any difficulty building, testing, understanding the code, ...
get in touch with the maintainer.



Pull Request
------------
Before submitting a Pull Request, feel free to add your name/nickname
in the AUTHORS file.

In order to make your Pull Request easily accepted,
have a look at the tools helping keeping the code functional / clean.

These may help making sure the tests were considered.
Furthermore, some points of the coding style are checked.

You may run the following at the root of the project:
$> tools/coding_style.sh src/
$> tools/check_headers.sh src/
$> tests/tests.sh

If you're planning to commit regularly, you may use some git hooks
(see the tools/git/hooks/ folder)

Ideally, before fixing a bug, a non-regression test should be written.



Tools
-----
Although the default used compiler is g++ one might want to compile
with another compiler. For instance, to compile with clang, use:
CXX=clang++ WE_EXTRA_CXXFLAGS=-Wno-unknown-warning-option ./bootstrap

Warning:
As the C++20 standard is recent, main stream compilers do not support it fully
yet. For instance, p0458r2 (map::contains()) is not supported yet by clang




In any case, feel free to contact the maintainer on github.

Thank you!
