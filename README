War Evolved is a simple 2D tactical RPG

To build the project, the following are required:
- autotools
- make
- A C++17 compliant compiler
- The SFML (version >= 2.3)

As the C++17 standard is recent, you may have to build a compiler from sources.
You may also need to indicate the path to a recent libc to run the binary using:
> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib ./we


At the root, run
> ./bootstrap

The binary file (we) should be created at the root of the project.


If you experience any problem,
please refer to the HELP text file at the root of the project.


To generate the documentation, at the root, run
> doxygen

you will need:
- graphviz to generate caller graphs
- doxygen
