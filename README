War Evolved is a simple 2D tactical RPG

to compile it, you'll need autotools, make, g++ and SFML2+ (2.3)
run
> ./autogen.sh

The binary file (we) should be created at the root


To generate the documentation, you will need:
- graphviz to generate caller graphs
- doxygen


NOTE: to install SFML
You can install the following packages in your packet manager:
libsfml-dev libsfml-graphics2.3v5 (names / versions may vary)
As an alternative, you can download it from it's official website
and copy the library files into in /usr/lib
(the path depends on your system / configuration)
