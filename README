War Evolved is a simple 2D tactical RPG

To build the project, the following are required:
- autotools
- make
- A C++ compiler with at least experimental C++20 support
- The SFML (version >= 2.3)

As the C++20 standard is recent, your compiler might not yet fully comply to it.
Therefore, you may have to build a compiler from sources.
You may also need to indicate the path to a recent libc to run the binary using:
> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib ./we


At the root of the project, run
> ./bootstrap

After configuring, the project will be built in the build/ directory.
The binary file (we) should be created at the project's root.


If you experience any problem, you may
- Run `./bootstrap --help`
- Refer to the HELP text file at the root of the project.
- Please, ask for help on Github


To generate the documentation, at the root, run
> doxygen


Required packages
-----------------
In order to generate the documentation you will need:
- graphviz for the caller graphs
- doxygen

To generate the enums, gawk is required


On a debian system, you may run:
> sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libx11-dev libsfml-dev graphviz doxygen gawk



Release Build
-------------
One need to explicit
- deactivate the debug informations
- undefine the DEBUG symbol
- strip the binary
WE_EXTRA_CXXFLAGS='-UDEBUG -O3 -g0 -ggdb0 -s' ./bootstrap



Cross-Compiling
---------------
You might want to check the
--sysroot option of gcc (or equivalent for your compiler)
--host option of configure

Build example for aarch64:
CXX="aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ --sysroot=/absolute/path/rfs/" ./configure --host=aarch64

NOTE: The previous mentioned libraries (libX11, SFML, ...) must be installed in the given sysroot
(if not found, double check the --sysroot argument is absolute)



Notes
-----
If you haven't downloaded War Evolved on GitHub,
you still can find it there https://github.com/zermingore/warevolved
to make sure you have the latest version


War Evolved is still under developpement (and not yet designed to be played)
but please report any bug, feature request, ...


Have Fun and Thank You for downloading / playing
