War Evolved is a simple 2D tactical RPG

to compile it, you'll need autotools, make, g++ and SFML2+ (2.1)
run
> ./autogen.sh

if it works, the binary file (we) will be created

NOTE: to install SFML 2.1
you can download it from it' s official website
and copy the library files into in /usr/lib
(the path depends on your system / configuration)


This project is under GPL license though uses PugiXML,
a XML file parser which is under Boost license
I have not written any code in src/pugixml folder
credits go to Arseny Kapoulkine (https://github.com/zeux/pugixml)

If you haven't downloaded War Evolved on google code,
you still can find it there https://code.google.com/p/warevolved/

War Evolved is still under developpement (and not yet designed to be played)
