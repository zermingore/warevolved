*WARNING*
---------
**This project here is only mirror of https://git.sr.ht/~jp_foss/war_evolved**
**The development here on github is stalled and will probably switch in Read Only at some point.**
**The development of War Evolved continues on sourcehut. See you there!**



War Evolved is a simple 2D tactical RPG

To build the project, the following are required:
- autotools
- make
- A C++ compiler with at least experimental C++20 support
- The SFML (version >= 2.3)

As the C++20 standard is recent, your compiler might not yet fully comply to it.
Therefore, you may have to build a compiler from sources.
You may also need to indicate the path to a recent libc to run the binary using:
> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib ./we


At the root of the project, run
> ./bootstrap

After configuring, the project will be built in the build/ directory.
The binary file (we) should be created at the project's root.


If you experience any problem, you may
- Run `./bootstrap --help`
- Refer to the HELP text file at the root of the project.
- Please, ask for help on **sourcehut** or per mail (see the AUTHORS file)


To generate the documentation, at the root, run
> doxygen


Required packages
-----------------
In order to generate the documentation you will need:
- graphviz for the caller graphs
- doxygen

To generate the enums, gawk is required


On a debian system, you may run:
> sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libx11-dev libsfml-dev graphviz doxygen gawk



Release Build
-------------
One need to explicit
- deactivate the debug informations
- undefine the DEBUG symbol
- strip the binary
WE_EXTRA_CXXFLAGS='-UDEBUG -O3 -g0 -ggdb0 -s' ./bootstrap



Cross-Compiling
---------------
You might want to check the
--sysroot option of gcc (or equivalent for your compiler)
--host option of configure

Build example for aarch64:
CXX="aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ --sysroot=/absolute/path/rfs/" ./configure --host=aarch64

NOTE: The previous mentioned libraries (libX11, SFML, ...) must be installed in the given sysroot
(if not found, double check the --sysroot argument is absolute)



Notes
-----
If you haven't downloaded War Evolved on sourcehut,
you still can find it there https://git.sr.ht/~jp_foss/war_evolved
to make sure you have the latest version
Please **DO NOT** clone / develop on github


War Evolved is still under developpement (and not yet designed to be played)
but please report (at https://todo.sr.ht/~jp_foss/war_evolved/) any bug, feature request, ...


Have Fun and Thank You for downloading / playing
