zoom on some area -> change time frame
(full city -> 1h; 1 block -> 10 min; 1 street -> 30s; micro move: 10s)

pick an area of 10 x 10 cells
-> zoom inside ~full screen: 30x30

allow to micro / macro
(go from A to B: osef; street gunfight with few units: micro manage every ~10s)

guard a door / building can easily last days; get out of a building: a few minutes


beginning of the game:
micro only, then ~blocked in semi macro
then allow the user to switch live

limit the number of order we can give (~1 every 10s ?)

a tank moves from a city to another one: ~3h
user A makes this move

In the same turn, how to handle:
allow to give orders like go from A to B (will last 1h)
and give a soldier the order to cross a street (10s)

move a plane from A to B (5 min)
move a tank  from A to B (3 hours)


could: give the order, the unit will move during some hours
(multiple turns, can be interrupted)
and hit next turn (default value / user definable ?)


End turn -> everything start at once ?
