* CORE
** multi-plateform
** website

* GRAPHICS
** realist (satellite pictures ?) / dark
** 2D / 3D / Mixx ? (2D maps with 3D units? xD)
** use of Strategy Design Pattern (3D, 2D, Ascii-Art) with templates (compile-time)
** background: satellite view

* GAMEPLAY
** multiples stairs
** day / night
** fires (propagation [equip genie with extinguishers ?]) / projectors
** ameliorations (new stuff)
** weapon shoot selector (bullet per bullet, ...)
** thermal vision
** recrut in town / form in center
** supply (mall, stations)
** war_fog unit is displayed for 3 days (even if it's gone)
** structures ? (bunker, command center...)
** blind shots : 25% hit rate ; 50% damages
** action: velocity & ammo & aim Gauges
** map: buildings / tunnels, units can enter (change view [-> map])
** multi scale levels (microing a soldier [inside a building]), macroing a chopper
** macro scale: not sure where small units are (eventually, fires on more than one cell at a time)
   could use a delay between sight by micro units and sight by macro units
** gas stations / hospital / market control
** wind ?
** field of earing
** field of view: only if day duration < 1 min (else: suppose units can check behind)
** patrol
** motion
   a plane (carrier) cannot perform a 180
   nor a chopper (function of velocity)
** macro / micro
   is a vehicule a macro or micro ?
   transport, Tank, Jeep
** allow to play a map matching player physical location
** attack coordination between two units
** map themes stopwatch (sinking submarine)
** fog of war: fake detonations (pull foes, allowing ambush with silencers)
2+ Vs *: same faction plays simultaneously (allow packing units, ...) ?
2+ Vs *: same day, different turn (only one attack at the end of the day)

join 2 same type: minimum of both move left
join soldier / vehicule packable: vehicule move left

** Terrains
   river (water strength, could need lifejacket, palms [1 per Soldier])
   canyon rope needed (only one per team)

note: closer than a simulator than a game...
-> dual modes ?
** radio
   to give an order to a unit, this one must have a radio
   (else only one order when splitting teams [patrol, move])
** loot
   fetch pieces on damaged vehicles
   fetch stuff on bodies (jacket -> get appearance, need Ad-Hoc to avoid friendly fire)
   bleuprints


* UNITS
** SOLDIER
*** clips
*** wounds
*** backpack / inventory (25 slots -> medkit / clips / ... / if dead -> allowed to pick it up)

** VEHICULES
*** fuel ?
*** crew ?
*** repair cost ?
*** damages

** HEROES ?

** FLYINGS
*** PLANES: departure, target, arrival
*** CHOPPERS: departure, target [arrival] [land]

** Experience
*** as Crew member
mechanics, cruise, gunner
(improve resistance, move, accuracy)

base: recruit && build inventory
specialisation (driver, sniper, ...)

install tyrolienne [en] between two mountains

train units

* ITEMS
** Tools
   shovel toolbox

* SCENARIO
** Humans Vs Humans ?
** 2100+ (need to print vehicles parts, with 3D printer)
** aircraft, with a 3D printer
*** build units
*** build some stuff (riffles, ...)
*** can drop it (could take shots)
*** can land
**** safer for content
**** higher risks for the plane
**** set up a printer on ground
**** longer than
** drones to harvest resources
** Fr nuclear plants failure ?



* UPGRADES
** Soldier
*** Silencer
*** Ad-Hoc communications
	avoid shooting allies
*** Helmet with Noise-{canceller,enhancer}
** Helicopter
*** Carbon propeller blades
    avoid getting shot by riffles / shreds


* OTHERS
** social_groups (Twitter, Facebook, MySpace...)
** allow to store saves on server
** editor
** videos
** on-line version
** DS / 3DS / Wii / IPhone / Andro√Ød versions
** MULTI
*** accounts (100 firsts free ? ; core free)
*** MMO-like (huge map...)
*** dedicaed server
** Interface
*** hover unit: fps view
**** allow focusing a target ?
**** lights ON / OFF
** [#C] Manage fights with RODS
