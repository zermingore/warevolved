* TODO Roadmap
** DONE Debug: Name threads
   CLOSED: [2020-07-29 Wed 08:23]
** TODO Fix doxygen warnings
** TODO Check included headers used
** TODO Panel clean (code && graphics: make text width panel size dependent)


* TODO Bugs / Features
** TODO Units
*** TODO In crew menu, 'Confirm' should be available only on changes
*** TODO Sometimes, moving over an enemy unit is possible
    Seems to appear when two keys are pressed at the same time
    Unable to wait on an occupied cell though
    Cannot reproduce it (October 2019)
*** TODO Crew 'Passenger' not used

** TODO Graphics
*** TODO Resize the window: center the map
*** TODO Resize the window: propagate new panel positions
*** DONE The cursor appears over the menus
    CLOSED: [2020-07-29 Wed 19:34]
*** TODO Panel: Pilot and Co-Pilot fonts differ
*** TODO Panel: Info font (next to the unit sprite) is too big

** TODO Misc
*** TODO Loading a map and 'next turn' should properly initalize every non-current player units 'played' flag
*** TODO Invoking the Panel seems to 'draw' a Terrain Sprite between the Panel and the Map
*** TODO [Panel] Remove the Unit Sprite double draw in order to make sure the Unit sprite is displayed
*** DONE Bootstrap: do not hard-code the path to the configure
    CLOSED: [2020-07-28 Tue 10:52]


* TODO Doc
** TODO Options
** TODO Document the coding style


* TODO Clean
** TODO Pointer parameters (should pass smart_ptr only when sharing the ownership)
** TODO Avoid casts to graphic types, overriding some methods
** TODO Map iterator to access cells without explicit double loop
   (Used in PathFinding GraphicsEngine Map MiniMap at least)
** TODO Merge Cell highlight boolean and color (color::None)
** TODO Capture lambda as reference when possible
** TODO Use the uniformed initialization
** TODO Find a way to have compile-time map keys (vehicle crews)
** TODO Map random generation


* TODO Experimental
** TODO drawInterface Vs drawState
   drawState draws the interface ?
** TODO Cursor (interface) in its thread
** TODO Player_id: use an enum (CURRENT, IA1, PLAYER1, PLAYER2, ...)


* TODO Input
** DONE Use the mouse to move the cursor, browse menus...
   CLOSED: [2020-07-29 Wed 19:35]
** TODO Clear the events fifo on State changes
** TODO Merge InputsListener EventsProcessor and KeyManager in a common static class ?
** DONE Make sure the events_log is saved before quitting the game
   CLOSED: [2020-07-30 Thu 17:45]


* TODO Game Features
** TODO Load the last save (with an option flag?)
   How to know where it's located


* TODO Code Design
** TODO auto-generate Resources XML file
** TODO follow the C++ rule of 0
** TODO Avoid vector of vector
   (std::vector<std::vector<Cell>> for the Map)
** TODO think about cleaning some types names
   (std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Type>>> -> typedef)
   could use using std::vector
   could use typedef std::shared_ptr SP
** TODO Random generator as a service locator


* TODO Graphics
** TODO Implement cell scrolling (too many cells to fit on the screen)
** TODO Apply a background to the main window
** TODO Multiple graphics::Image share the same sprite
   -> require to re-set the sprite position, rotation, ... before drawing
   (is it an issue)


* TODO Resources
** TODO Sprites
*** TODO Interface
**** TODO Side panel
***** TODO Frontground (plastic cover like)
***** TODO [#B] New background matching the frontground
*** TODO Units
**** TODO Soldiers team
**** TODO Jeep
*** TODO Terrain
**** TODO Mountain
*** TODO Buildings
**** TODO Block


* TODO Gameplay
** TODO Meteo
*** TODO Graphics: add a snowy transparent sprite
** TODO Multi-Cells units?


* TODO Sound
** TODO 3D sound (using OpenAL)


* TODO Interface
** TODO Highlight possible targets when hovering a unit
** TODO Menu Bar
** TODO Configuration file
** TODO select between satellite or schematic view
** TODO unit selection -> 'flashing lights'
** TODO center text in in-game menu entries
** TODO Display last killed unit list



* TODO Graphics Engine
** TODO Units filter sprite
** TODO Units orientation
   only graphic attribute ?
   use while moving a unit (default: look ahead, can check a side)
** TODO Sprites management
   merge on common themes
   1 theme -> 1 load, 1 free


* TODO Menu
** TODO Main menu


* TODO Tools
** TODO Global log
*** TODO Merge every log entries, by timestamps
*** TODO html / xml output
*** TODO css / xmlss
** TODO Commit checker
*** TODO memory leaks checker before commit
*** TODO auto-compile / launch for all build rules
*** TODO auto generate documentation
** TODO auto resources XML generator
** TODO Options parser
*** TODO Options structure to initialize the Game
*** TODO Framerate (blocked to 60 in release; unlimited in debug)
** TODO The displayed fps should be computed only over a fixed period of time
** TODO Check if the generated enums_printer need an update on commit/push


* TODO Testing
** TODO Integration Test process
*** TODO Use screenshots for the interface
   ex: SELECTION key was pressed -> save the video buffer, a menu must be open
   Use OpenCV to get the distance between the images
** TODO Unit tests
   using google tests?
   really brings something?
** TODO [#B] Disable the graphics engine (speeding up testing)
   May be considered later, if the process is indeed too slow because of it
   (The build process still takes more than a minute)
** TODO Memory Leaks / Errors: periodic controls



* TODO [#C] Optimization
  -> *Profile* <-
** TODO improve InGameMenu stack usage
   Do *NOT* rebuild all entries each frame...
** TODO Sprites
   Every cell doesn't need to have it's own highlight sprite
   -> common sprites (1 per situation [move, attack])
** TODO Panel Cache
   The Panel is re-built at every frame
