   CLOSED: [2018-11-12 Mo 19:47]
** DONE --seed-gen=%d option to generate a random map with the given seed
   CLOSED: [2018-11-14 Mi 20:19]
** TODO Random generator as a service locator


* TODO Doc
** DONE Home page
   CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fr 21:29]
** TODO Options


* TODO Clean
** TODO Pointer parameters (should pass smart_ptr only when sharing the ownership)
** TODO Avoid casts to graphic types, overriding some methods
** TODO Map iterator to access cells without explicit double loop
   (Used in PathFinding GraphicsEngine Map MiniMap at least)
** TODO Merge Cell highlight boolean and color (color::None)
** TODO Do not pass shared pointers as parameter when not usefull


* TODO Experimental
** TODO drawInterface Vs drawState
   drawState draws the interface ?
** TODO Cursor (interface) in its thread
** TODO Handle external libs (pugixml) in submodules ?
** TODO Player_id: use an enum (CURRENT, IA1, PLAYER1, PLAYER2, ...)


* TODO Input
** TODO Use the mouse to move the cursor, browse menus...
** TODO Clear the events fifo on State changes
** TODO Merge InputsListener EventsProcessor and KeyManager in a common static class ?


* TODO Game Features
** TODO Load the last save (with an option flag?)


* TODO Code Design
** TODO use emplace[_back] with std::vector (C++11)
   (instead of create and push)
** TODO auto-generate Resources XML file
*** TODO OS-dependant in script language
**** TODO Shell Script
**** TODO [#C] .bat
*** TODO non-OS dependant (in C++)
** TODO follow the C++ rule of 0
** TODO Avoid vector of vector
   (std::vector<std::vector<Cell>> for the Map)
** DONE Hunt dead code
   CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fr 20:54]
** TODO think about cleaning some types names
   (std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Type>>> -> typedef)
   could use using std::vector
   could use typedef std::shared_ptr SP


* TODO Graphics
** TODO Implement cell scrolling (too many cells to fit on the screen)
** TODO Apply a background to the main window
** TODO Multiple graphics::Image share the same sprite
   -> require to re-set the sprite position, rotation, ... before drawing
   (is it an issue)


* TODO Resources
** TODO Sprites
*** TODO Interface
**** TODO Side panel
***** TODO Frontground (plastic cover like)

* TODO Gameplay
** TODO Meteo
*** TODO Graphics: add a snowy transparent sprite
** TODO Fog of War
*** TODO Vision
*** TODO Field of View ?
	Sniper: very good vision, poor field of view (angle)
*** TODO field of hearing
	know there's a unit nearby
	avoid embushes
** TODO more than one unit per cell (helicopter / soldier)
   could use more than one plan (one for ground units, one for air units)
*** TODO Tunnels
   could use different levels of zoom (micro-ing a soldier, macro-ing a tank)
** DONE save / load from file (XML / own ?)
   CLOSED: [2018-10-28 So 08:43]
** TODO dual windows (main window / infos panel)
** TODO Customize gear
   (riffles, kevlar, silencer, vehicles options)
** TODO ammo management
   by clip || bullet per bullet
** TODO Genie
   building Heliport, wounded evac
   repair center
   bury mines
   dig
   build bridges
** TODO units ranks / promotion / leader
** TODO Motion
*** TODO Move Management
   for each cell: simply move, shoot somewhere or sprint
   could micro a 5 soldier team:
     (5 cells max motion)
     2 fires at cell #2 to the north, 3 fires at cell #3 to the south
	 team regroup at #cell 4 (open fire costs 1 move)
*** TODO Open Fire Management
	while moving
	Shift on a cell: sprint (increase move costs, reduces damages taken)
	  [manage wounded whiles sprinting ?]
	Control on a cell: open fire in mouse direction
	  8 surrounding cells (less damages, even less for not 4 'direct' cells)
	  ground unit: manage how many bullets per shot ?
	  allow spamming ?
	  vehicles: rotating turret required
	    (else: fire more or less only straight shots)
		(while moving ?)
	Alt on a cell: unit rotation
	  increase reactivity
	  only on simple move

    use SFML if available, else SDL, pure OpenGL, ASCII, DirectX, ...

*** TODO Load a map, a replay, save at the end; compare with a reference map
** TODO game scripts (need to be able to use pre-recorded input)
** TODO Use an ascii map to check fight behavior
** TODO Use screenshots for the interface
   ex: SELECTION key was pressed -> save the video buffer, a menu must be open
   Use OpenCV to get the distance between the images
** TODO The displayed fps should be computed only over a fixed period of time
** TODO Use git hooks in order to make sure the tests were considered
** TODO Disable the graphics engine (speeding up testing)


* TODO Bugs / Features
** TODO Memory Leaks / Errors
** TODO segfault while quitting the game, moving a unit
   This happen because every static classes get 'destructed', exiting the main
   Example: Status keeps a shared_ptr to a Battle and one to a StateMovingUnit.
     The destructor of StateMovingUnit relies on the validity of the shared_ptr on Battle
   To solve this, one can for instance:
   - Find a way to 'destruct' static classes in a defined order
   - As the static classes may be removed one day this would solve the issue
** TODO Sometimes, moving over an enemy unit is possible
   Seems to appear when two keys are pressed at the same time
   Unable to wait on an occupied cell though
** TODO Resizable window
   Start the game in a small window; put the window in full screen
   -> The resolution is broken


* Build


* TODO [#C] Optimization
  -> *Profile* <-
** TODO improve InGameMenu stack usage
   Do *NOT* rebuild all entries each frame...
** TODO Sprites
   Every cell doesn't need to have it's own highlight sprite
   -> common sprites (1 per situation [move, attack])
