* TODO Roadmap
** TODO Testing: Integration tests draft


* TODO Bugs / Features
** TODO Units
*** TODO In crew menu, 'Confirm' should be available only on changes
*** TODO Sometimes, moving over an enemy unit is possible
    Seems to appear when two keys are pressed at the same time
    Unable to wait on an occupied cell though
    Cannot reproduce it (October 2019)
*** TODO Crew 'Passenger' not used

** TODO Graphics
*** TODO Resize the window: center the map
*** TODO Resize the window: propagate new panel positions
*** TODO The cursor appears over the menus
*** TODO Panel: Pilot and Co-Pilot fonts differ
*** TODO Panel: Info font (next to the unit sprite) is too big
** TODO Loading a map and 'next turn' should properly initalize every non-current player units 'played' flag
** TODO Invoking the Panel seems to 'draw' a Terrain Sprite between the Panel and the Map
** TODO [Panel] Remove the Unit Sprite double draw in order to make sure the Unit sprite is displayed
** TODO Bootstrap: do not hard-code the path to the configure
** TODO Seed 3696412022 move unit && dead lock?


* TODO Doc
** TODO Options
** TODO Clean the think/ folder
** TODO Document the coding style


* TODO Clean
** TODO Pointer parameters (should pass smart_ptr only when sharing the ownership)
** TODO Avoid casts to graphic types, overriding some methods
** TODO Map iterator to access cells without explicit double loop
   (Used in PathFinding GraphicsEngine Map MiniMap at least)
** TODO Merge Cell highlight boolean and color (color::None)
** TODO Capture lambda as reference when possible
** TODO Use the uniformed initialization
** DONE Factories: return unique_ptr
   CLOSED: [2019-10-19 Sat 15:09]
** TODO Find a way to have compile-time map keys (vehicle crews)
** DONE Event logger no longer in debug namespace
   CLOSED: [2019-10-15 Tue 18:44]
** DONE Dirty generated enum / not up to date
   CLOSED: [2019-10-19 Sat 08:52]
** TODO Map random generation
** TODO Do not put enums in common as default (+ sort them)


* TODO Experimental
** TODO drawInterface Vs drawState
   drawState draws the interface ?
** TODO Cursor (interface) in its thread
** TODO Handle external libs (pugixml) in submodules ?
** TODO Player_id: use an enum (CURRENT, IA1, PLAYER1, PLAYER2, ...)
** TODO Random generator as a service locator
** DROPPED Upgrade SFML
   CLOSED: [2019-10-19 Sat 15:21]
   Already using 2.5 (last 2.5.1)
** TODO Give clang-tidy a try


* TODO Input
** TODO Use the mouse to move the cursor, browse menus...
** TODO Clear the events fifo on State changes
** TODO Merge InputsListener EventsProcessor and KeyManager in a common static class ?
** TODO Make sure the events_log is saved before quitting the game


* TODO Game Features
** TODO Load the last save (with an option flag?)
   How to know where it's located


* TODO Code Design
** TODO use emplace[_back] with std::vector (C++11)
   (instead of create and push)
** TODO auto-generate Resources XML file
*** TODO OS-dependant in script language
**** TODO Shell Script
**** TODO [#C] .bat
*** TODO non-OS dependant (in C++)
** TODO follow the C++ rule of 0
** TODO Avoid vector of vector
   (std::vector<std::vector<Cell>> for the Map)
** TODO think about cleaning some types names
   (std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Type>>> -> typedef)
   could use using std::vector
   could use typedef std::shared_ptr SP
** TODO Random generator as a service locator


* TODO Graphics
** TODO Implement cell scrolling (too many cells to fit on the screen)
** TODO Apply a background to the main window
** TODO Multiple graphics::Image share the same sprite
   -> require to re-set the sprite position, rotation, ... before drawing
   (is it an issue)


* TODO Resources
** TODO Sprites
*** TODO Interface
**** TODO Side panel
***** TODO Frontground (plastic cover like)
***** TODO [#B] New background matching the frontground
*** TODO Units
**** TODO Soldiers team
**** TODO Jeep
*** TODO Terrain
**** TODO Mountain
*** TODO Buildings
**** TODO Block


* TODO Gameplay
** TODO Meteo
*** TODO Graphics: add a snowy transparent sprite
** TODO Fog of War
*** TODO Vision
*** TODO Field of View ?
	Sniper: very good vision, poor field of view (angle)
*** TODO field of hearing
	know there's a unit nearby
	avoid embushes
** TODO more than one unit per cell (helicopter / soldier)
   could use more than one plan (one for ground units, one for air units)
*** TODO Tunnels
   could use different levels of zoom (micro-ing a soldier, macro-ing a tank)
** TODO dual windows (main window / infos panel)
** TODO Customize gear
   (riffles, kevlar, silencer, vehicles options)
** TODO ammo management
   by clip || bullet per bullet
** TODO Genie
   building Heliport, wounded evac
   repair center
   bury mines
   dig
   build bridges
** TODO units ranks / promotion / leader
** TODO Motion
*** TODO Move Management
   for each cell: simply move, shoot somewhere or sprint
   could micro a 5 soldier team:
     (5 cells max motion)
     2 fires at cell #2 to the north, 3 fires at cell #3 to the south
	 team regroup at #cell 4 (open fire costs 1 move)
*** TODO Open Fire Management
	while moving
	Shift on a cell: sprint (increase move costs, reduces damages taken)
	  [manage wounded whiles sprinting ?]
	Control on a cell: open fire in mouse direction
	  8 surrounding cells (less damages, even less for not 4 'direct' cells)
	  ground unit: manage how many bullets per shot ?
	  allow spamming ?
	  vehicles: rotating turret required
	    (else: fire more or less only straight shots)
		(while moving ?)
	Alt on a cell: unit rotation
	  increase reactivity
	  only on simple move
** TODO Multi-Cells units?

** TODO Libraries
*** TODO [#C] switch 'on demand' (at compilation time)
    use SFML if available, else SDL, pure OpenGL, ASCII, DirectX, ...

** TODO The displayed fps should be computed only over a fixed period of time
** TODO Check if the generated enums_printer need an update on commit/push


* TODO Testing
** TODO Integration Test process
*** TODO Load a map, a replay, save at the end; compare with a reference map
*** TODO Use screenshots for the interface
   ex: SELECTION key was pressed -> save the video buffer, a menu must be open
   Use OpenCV to get the distance between the images
** TODO Unit tests
   using google tests?
** TODO [#B] Disable the graphics engine (speeding up testing)
   May be considered later, if the process is indeed too slow because of it
   (The build process still takes more than a minute)
** TODO Memory Leaks / Errors: periodic controls


* Build


* TODO [#C] Optimization
  -> *Profile* <-
** TODO improve InGameMenu stack usage
   Do *NOT* rebuild all entries each frame...
** TODO Sprites
   Every cell doesn't need to have it's own highlight sprite
   -> common sprites (1 per situation [move, attack])
** TODO Panel Cache
   The Panel is re-built at every frame
