In this file is kept a list of fixed bugs
-----------------------------------------


** DONE It is possible to select enemy units
   CLOSED: [2017-10-13 Fr 07:45]


** DONE segfault poping states (pressed 'escape' on the map State, after canceling a move)
   CLOSED: [2017-10-23 Mo 07:41]
   Closing it as it seems solved by the new way to treat events (one per frame)


** DONE Attacking without moving is not possible
   CLOSED: [2017-10-16 Mo 08:08]
   Prior to attack, a move on another cell is required


** DONE Spurious "Invalid direction" while moving a Unit
   CLOSED: [2017-10-23 Mo 07:39]
   Saw it with direction 0 (picked a unit, moved it down 2 times)
   Saw it giving the wait order (not while moving)
   As now only one event maximum is used per frame, it should solve the issue

   # Moving a Unit:
   *** Error in `./we': free(): corrupted unsorted chunks: 0x000000000110f2a0 ***

   To test the fix, some sleeps were added in the EventsProcessing, PathFinding and States,
   to check the operations order consistency


** DONE Attacking a Unit can lead to a crash
   CLOSED: [2017-10-23 Mo 07:40]
   Assertion !_targets->empty() && "StateSelectTarget: no target available" failed
   As now only one event maximum is used per frame, it should solve the issue


** DONE X11 and multi-threading
   CLOSED: [2017-08-17 Do 07:21]
   The XInitThreads() function must be called before the creation of the threads using X
   The include Xlib.h defines a macro 'NONE' conflicting with a value in the sf::Style enum
   -> the Xlib.h must be included after the SFML ones
   the Xlib.h also defines a Status symbol conflicting with the Status class of War Evolved
   (to avoid conflicts, the Status class was moved in a namespace)

   X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
   Major opcode of failed request:  152 (DRI2)
   Minor opcode of failed request:  8 (DRI2SwapBuffers     )
   Resource id in failed request:  0xe00009
   Serial number of failed request:  12382
   Current serial number in output stream:  12383
