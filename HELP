* INSTALL

** Build tools
You will need
- Autotools / automake
- make
- A recent C++ compiler (ideally with C++17 support, at least C++14).
The code is often only compiled with g++ and some gcc specific warnings are used


** SFML installation
As a minimal, the version 2.0 is strongly recommended
If your package manager supports it, you can directly install the sfml meta-package

Or else, you can install the following packages in your package manager:
libsfml-dev libsfml-graphics2.3v5 (names / versions may vary)
As an alternative, you can download it from it's official website
and copy the library files into in /usr/lib
(the path depends on your system / configuration)



** Troubleshooting

*** Can't exec "aclocal"
Install automake

Can't exec "aclocal": No such file or directory at /usr/share/autoconf/Autom4te/FileUtils.pm line 326.
autoreconf: failed to run aclocal: No such file or directory


*** Unable to find SFML
Install the SFML with your package manager

configure: error: Unable to find SFML System


*** Make seems to loop forever complaining about modification time
Your system date might have change between the checkout of the sources and the build
