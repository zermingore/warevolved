* INSTALL

** Build tools
You will need
- Autotools / automake
- make
- A compiler with C++20 (at least experimental) support
The code is often only compiled with g++ and some gcc specific warnings are used


** SFML installation
As a minimal, the version 2.0 is strongly recommended
If your package manager supports it, you can directly install the sfml meta-package

Or else, you can install the following packages in your package manager:
libsfml-dev libsfml-graphics2.3v5 (names / versions may vary)
As an alternative, you can download it from it's official website
and copy the library files into in /usr/lib
(the path depends on your system / configuration)



** Troubleshooting

*** Can't exec "aclocal"
Install automake

Can't exec "aclocal": No such file or directory at /usr/share/autoconf/Autom4te/FileUtils.pm line 326.
autoreconf: failed to run aclocal: No such file or directory


*** Unable to find SFML
Install the SFML with your package manager

configure: error: Unable to find SFML System


*** Make seems to loop forever complaining about modification time
Your system date might have change between the checkout of the sources and the build

  /bin/sh /path/to/_warevolved/build-aux/missing automake-1.15 --foreign src/Makefile
  /bin/sh ./config.status src/Makefile depfiles
config.status: creating src/Makefile
config.status: executing depfiles commands
make[1]: Warning: File '../../src/Makefile.am' has modification time 6672 s in the future


*** Unable to execute the binary because of the version of the libstdc++
ISSUE:
./we: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.11' not found (required by ./we)
./we: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.22' not found (required by ./we)

SOLUTION:
Your libstdc++ is not compatible with the version used by War Evolved
(you might have to compile g++ to build the libstdc++)

Run War Evolved specifying the path to the libstdc++ library:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib ./we
